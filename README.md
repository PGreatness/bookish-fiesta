# import-teamname
A new site that has daily updates with weather, news, and a funny comic strip. The site will use each user's ip address (after given permission) to find the weather status of their location based on the IP API and Darksky API. The comics and news will be based on the xkcd API and the NewYorkTimes API. Every day there will be a new interesting article and comic strip!
